OreCore - Minimal
======= 

Copper, Tin, Aluminum

A minecraft mod which ONLY provides ores - hopefully to be used as a standard

Every item in this mod is obtainable somehow in Vanilla Minecraft.  No machines should be necessary.

All metals are obtainable as dust by shoveling their gravel.  For example, iron dust is obtainable from iron gravel 
ore.  Mind that, unless configured otherwise (TBD) it may be quite rare to come across these gravels.
